# @exponent/vector-icons

This library is a compatibility layer around
[@oblador/react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons)
to work with the Exponent asset system. If you're using React Native
without Exponent, you have no need for this library -- carry on! (or
maybe [check out Exponent](https://getexponent.com/).
